This is a model related to the notMnist datasets.
It include the data from A to J.It is simiar
to the mnist datasets.

Introductions
"""
In this project,you will get three versions of codes.
The first version is realized by many function and trained by MLP.
The seconed version is realized by class and trained by MLP.
The thrid version is realized by class and trained by CNN.

You can use the tensorboard to observing some results.
"""

Files and Directions
"""
The direction of the "model" is used to save the checkpoint 
and the train and the test results.

The direction of the "code" includes the whole code of this project.

The file of "test.ipynb" is the whole ipython file.You can watch it
in you computer.

The file of "notMnist_class.py" includes the class of the notMnist.
The file of "notMnist_class_cnn.py" include the class of the notMnist.
The file of "notMnist_function.py" includes the functions of the notMnist.

Run code
"""
It will host some time to download some file,If you run this code first time.
You will get the file "notMNIST_small.tar.gz" "notMNIST_large.tar.gz" 
"notMNIST_small"  "notMNIST_large" and so on.
